language recognision AI by Jonathan DÃ¶nszelmann

to use: install pyton with the following modules:
numpy
matplotlib

time		#probably already installed
string		#probably already installed
math		#probably already installed
random		#probably already installed
sys		#probably already installed

To start teaching the machine: run langrecog.py, select how many learning cycles it should do. Initially it will learn english and dutch but if you replace the dutch.txt and english.txt files with other languages and change to code to use those 2 files it will learn other languages.

To test the AI on what it learned, run execute.py and type some words. It will say what language it is (standard english and dutch) and how sure it is. This certainty will increase if you tain it longer. The training files it will use to execute are the 4 in the main folder. These will also be overwritten when you teach it new things. that's why there is a second folder with more training files. Initally it is loaded with training files from 2 million training cycles. This will work pretty well.

please do not copy and/or distribte without my permissions. Of course you can use it to learn yourself or others to make neural networks.
